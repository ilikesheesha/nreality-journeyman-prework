#Problem 1: FizzBuzz 
The task is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and
for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

##Output
The task output is a C# Console Application called Journeyman.Pre.FizzBuz. This console application runs on any Windows Platform with the .Net 4.5 runtime installed.

##Usage
The application can be executed at the command line by calling ```cmd>Journeyman.Pre.FizzBuz.exe```

Or it can be executed directly from Windows Explorer by Opening Journeyman.Pre.FizzBuz.exe. 

The application also supports two optional input parameters, the first is the lower limit of the number range to be processed, and the second is the upper limit of the number range to be executed. These are set by default to 1 and 100.
```
cmd>Journeyman.Pre.FizzBuz.exe 34 23423
```
